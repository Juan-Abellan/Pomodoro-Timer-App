<h2>Description</h2>

The Pomodoro Technique is an acclaimed time-management system created by Francesco Cirillo. Once we decide the task to develop the Pomodoro App display 4 working sets of 25 minutes, the 3 first working sets are followed by a 5 minutes breaks and after the 4th working set we finish with a longer 20 minutes break. Each time a working set is over the App displays a green check mark.
